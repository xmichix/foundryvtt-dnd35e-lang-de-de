Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.</p><p>A crawling tattoo must enter the target's square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target's threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack  per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo's touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.</p><p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p><p><i>Market Price:</i> The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.</p><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td><b>Power Level</b><br/></td> <td><b>Market Price</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>1st<br/></td>\n<td>50 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>2nd<br/></td>\n<td>300 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>3rd<br/></td>\n<td>750 gp<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p><i>Crawling tattoo of concussion</i>: This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of damage to a creature hit by its touch attack.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, <i>concussion blast</i>; Price 50 gp.</p><p><i>Crawling Tattoo of Energy Bolt</i>: Each of these tattoos is keyed to one energy type: cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p><p>The character with a <i>deck of many things</i> who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. <i>Exception:</i> If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.</p><p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A <i>deck of many things</i> contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table.

If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</p><p><i>Comet:</i> The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</p><p><i>Donjon:</i> This card signifies imprisonment- either by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</p><p><i>Euryale:</i> The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</p><p><i>Fates:</i> This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p><p><i>Flames:</i> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</p><p><i>Fool:</i> The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester.</p><p><i>Gem:</i> This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each.</p><p><i>Idiot:</i> This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</p><p><i>Jester:</i> This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional.</p><p><i>Key:</i> The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</p><p><i>Knight:</i> The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character.</p><p><i>Moon:</i> This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of <i>wishes</i> shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of <i>wishes</i> (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes</i> are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</p><p><i>Rogue:</i> When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</p><p><i>Ruin:</i> As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</p><p><i>Skull:</i> A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone-if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>.</p><p><i>Star:</i> The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.</p><p><i>Sun:</i> Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p><p><i>Talons:</i> When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.</p><p><i>Throne:</i> The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</p><p><i>Vizier:</i> This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.</p><p><i>The Void:</i> This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.</p><p>Strong (all schools); CL 20th.</p><p/>\n</div>\n    "

When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.</p><p>If a <i>figurine of wondrous power</i> is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p><p><i>Bronze Griffon:</i> When animated, a <i>bronze griffon</i> acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the <i>bronze griffon</i> once again becomes a tiny statuette.</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 10,000 gp.</p><p><i>Ebony Fly:</i> When animated, an <i>ebony fly</i> is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the <i>ebony fly</i> again becomes a tiny statuette.</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 10,000 gp.</p><p><i>Golden Lions:</i> These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 16,500 gp.</p><p><i>Ivory Goats:</i> These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:</p><ul>\n <li> <i>The Goat of Traveling:</i> This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.</li>\n <li> <i>The Goat of Travail:</i> This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li>\n <li> <i>The Goat of Terror:</i> When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance</i>,  the other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the <i>goat of terror</i> radiates <i>fear</i> as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</li>\n</ul><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 21,000 gp.</p><p><i>Marble Elephant:</i> This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a <i>marble elephant</i> grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 17,000 gp.</p><p><i>Obsidian Steed:</i> This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: <i>overland flight</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>,  and <i>ethereal jaunt</i>. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an <i>obsidian steed</i> becomes ethereal or <i>plane shifts</i>,  its rider and his gear follow suit.</p><p>Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.</p><p>Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>,  <i>etherealness</i>,  <i>fly</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>; Price 28,500 gp.</p><p><i>Onyx Dog:</i> When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can <i>see invisibility</i>. An <i>onyx dog</i> can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 15,500 gp.</p><p><i>Serpentine Owl:</i> This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.)</p><p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>; Price 9,100 gp.</p><p><i>Silver Raven:</i> This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an <i>animal messenger</i> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.</p><p>Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animal messenger</i>,  <i>animate objects</i>; Price 3,800 gp.</p>\n</div>\n    "

Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies.

The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p><p>A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p><p>Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p><p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.</p><p>If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>,  the rolls are opposed.
